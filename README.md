# MP-9-Bit-Trees-and-Braile
Due: Wednesday April 24, 2024 

Acknowledgements: The online resources I used for this project are the bit tree reading, Eboard 35, and the JavaOracle documentation for conversions. 
I discussed ideas about the project with classmates: Medhashree Adhikari, Connor Heagy, and Candice Lu. I got help from the tutors: Jayson, Audrey, Simon, and Boston. I also recieved help form Professor Rebelskey. 

Short Description: The BrailleASCII file converts to braille, ascii, or unicode depending on the inputs given in the command line. It converts based on the initial bit tree structures. The user types in a type they want the input to convert to for the first command argument and the input of what they want to convert as the second input. 

Instructions for Running the program: Compile BrailleASCII.java file. Then run the program by giving the first command argument what you want to convert it to. The arguments for the first argument should be braille, ascii, or unicode. The second argument should be what you what to convert from to convert too. If you give the first argument braille, the second argument should be of an ASCII type to convert from Braille to ASCII. If you give the first argument ascii, the second argument braille, you should convert from braille to ascii. If you give the first argument unicode, the second argument should be an ASCII type which will convert from ascii to braille and braille to unicode.
